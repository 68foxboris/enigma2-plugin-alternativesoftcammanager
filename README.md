AlternativeSoftCamManager
=========
Enigma2 plugin to start, stop, restart softcams, change setting path.

Just put softcams in the folder (by default /var/emu or /usr/bin/cam),
put the config files to another folder (by default /var/keys) and use the plugin to manage them.

Do not need any startup scripts or something else.
If necessary, the plugin knows how to work with scripts in config folder,
who manage sofcams with commands start and stop.
If you want to use other folders, they can be set in the config screen.
